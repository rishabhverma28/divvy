# Divvy

## Components
There are 2 components to the app:
- The Front End(FR/) and the Backend(backend/)
- To run the app successfully, you must run both.
- Follow the steps mentioned in both the folders for details on how to run the app.


## Further Development
- If given more time to work on the task, I would work on the UI of the app.
- Introducing a line graph instead of showing the data points.
